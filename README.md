# Pewlett Hackard Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
Pewlett Hackard is a large company that wants to plan for the upcoming retirements of many of their employees. I've been helping Bobby, an HR analyst, with some employee research to help leadership figure out how many employees will reach retirement age. The purpose of this analysis is to create databases and determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 

## Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

1. Over 72,000 employees will be eligible to retire.
2. The majority, over 50,000, of those are in Senior positions like Senior Engineer and Senior Staff.

Below is a screenshot from the retiring_titles.csv database showing these numbers.

## Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
- How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?


- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
According the the mentorship_eligibility database created, there are 1549 retirement-ready employees available to mentor the next generation of employees. For a company of over ??? this is not very many.  It would be helpful to see in which Departments these employees are located as well as how many employees were available compared to the size of those Departments to determine where the greatests needs for mentorship are.
